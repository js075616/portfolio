# portfolio
Portfolio of some of the projects I have worked on.

Operating System Projects contains a Python program that simulates virtual memory and a simple version of the find program on Linux written in C++.

Python Data Mining contains the process I took through multiple projects to practice and understand data mining techniques.

Video Game Inventory System has a working inventory system for a text-based game that includes images and accesses information from an SQLite3 database. This was part of a much larger project, but I did all the work on the included files myself. It was built with Java Swing and JDK 13.0.2.
